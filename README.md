# 👋 Hi, I’m Kaitlyn! (she/her)

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a career-switcher with a background in Forensics and Anthropology, currently diving headfirst into the world of **Biological Data Science**. I'm endlessly curious about what we can learn from the patterns hiding in data — whether that's related to health, gaming, archaeology, or even my ever-growing tea collection ☕

## 🎓 A Quick Snapshot

🧪 I spent the early part of my career in **medical device R&D** and **manufacturing QC labs**, where I started working with real-world data and discovered I *loved it*.  
📚 Now, I’m pursuing a **Master’s in Biological Data Science** through ASU Online (Fall 2024–May 2026) while working full time in the QC laboratory.  
🌱 I’ve completed:
- Statistics for Biological Data Science I & II  
- Intro to Python Programming for Problem Solving  
- *Currently taking*: Database Systems & Python (hello, ERDs and SQL!)

## 🔬 What I'm Working On

📊 **Tea-rrific Analysis** — I cataloged and analyzed my 110+ tea collection because… why not?  
💔 **Heartbreak & Data** — Explored relationship status and heart health using NHANES in a stats project inspired by “Broken Heart Syndrome” ([yes, it’s real!](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354617)).  
🧬 **Lab ERD Design** — Planning out an Entity Relationship Diagram to help our lab integrate better with our new LIMS database. It's like digital anthropology; connecting the dots between all the sample data.

## 👀 Interests

- 🧬 Health & medical data  
- 🎮 Gaming & tech  
- 🔬 Biotech & environmental data  
- ☠️ Anthropological data (If you know anyone using data science in archaeology or osteology, I want to talk to them!)

## 💬 Let’s Connect

I'm the **Online Cohort Ambassador** for ASU's BDS program, and I love talking with others about learning paths, career pivots, and weirdly specific datasets.  
📫 Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlyn-schisler/) — I’m always up for a good data story!  
💻 Working on building a GitHub Pages portfolio soon, so stay tuned!

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I’ve participated in two major archaeological digs:  
🏺 One at a Mayan site in Belize, and another at a 17th-century graveyard in Poland.  
🍁 I also worked in public sector archaeology in ON, Canada from mid 2020 to late 2021.  
Let’s just say… I *really* dig bones.

## 🤝 Inspired By
I love learning from folks like Jess Ramos, Daliana Liu, and Andrew Jones, who make data science feel exciting, accessible, and full of possibility. If you have other creators or newsletters you recommend, send them my way!
