- 👋 Hi, I’m @k-schisler, but you can call me Kaitlyn. I'm a career pivoter looking to make a big switch! I have a Bachelors degree in Forensics and Anthropology, with experience in medical device R&D and QC lab procedures in Manufacturing. I'm looking to switch into a tech based career looking at data and extrapolating information from the trends hidden within them. I've gotten a taste for it in the R&D position I had where I was looking at large amounts of data from initial testing of the instrument and assay. I've been furthering that interest working in the Manufacturing QC lab, developing VBA code in Excel for rapid data analysis and reporting. This very small tip of the iceberg has me craving to dive head first into the water to see just how deep it can go!
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and big data! I love the idea of there being hidden patterns and information in data sets that can give clues into advancements and leading to new discoveries. It's my very own haystack filled with golden needles to find!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Biological Data Science at Arizona State University via their online graduate program! I'm hoping to use this profile to track my progress, practice, and learn from others! So far, I only have a base knowledge of SQL and Python, with a bit more experience in VBA for Excel. We've just started learning about R and RStudio in the stats class I'm enrolled in too!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm not sure yet! I want to get to a point where I feel comfortable utilizing the relevant tools before I try to contribute on projects with others. I'm definitely a learn-as-you-go kind of person, but I want to make sure I have some sort of foundation first! I suppose a good start could be the Kaggle competitions! In the future, I would love to be combining this new found passion with my desire to help others, whether that be through data analysis contributing to health/medicinal discoveries, or otherwise!
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm unsure if there's a system on here for contacting people (newbie alert!!), but I do have a LinkedIn profile I keep active on that I would love to connect on! https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlyn-schisler/
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I went abroad for two different archaeological digs! I excavated a Mayan city in Belize, as well as an unmarked graveyard in Poland from the 17th century! I have a deep passion for biological anthropology, I guess I just really *dig* bones.... you get it?
