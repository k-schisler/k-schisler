# 👋 Hi, I’m Kaitlyn! (she/her)

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! With a foundation in Forensics and Anthropology (B.Sc., Trent University), I'm currently diving head first into the world of **Data Science**. I'm endlessly curious about what we can learn from the patterns hiding in data. My biggest interests are:
- 🧬 Health & medical data  
- 🎮 Gaming & tech  
- 🔬 Biotech & environmental data  
- ☠️ Anthropological data (If you know anyone using data science in archaeology or osteology, I want to talk to them!)

<!--![Kaitlyn's GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=k-schisler&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight&hide=contribs&count_private=true)-->
Throughout my experiences, I've utilized Excel/VBA, Unix, SQL, Python, R, and others to a more minimal extent. However, I found this cool way to display what's here on my GitHub! Check it out ↓↓

## 🎓 A Quick Snapshot

🧪 I spent the early part of my career in **medical device R&D** and **manufacturing QC labs**, where I started working with real-world data and discovered I *loved it*.  
 
📚 Now, I’m pursuing a **Master’s in Biological Data Science** through Arizona State University Online (Fall 2024–May 2026), focusing on helping others and representing the students in the program.  
 
🌱 I’ve completed:
- Statistics for Biological Data Science I & II  
- Intro to Python Programming for Problem Solving
- Database Systems & Python
- Applied Math Tech in Biology
- Integrative Biology I
- Evolutionary Biology (Integrative Biology II)
- *In Progress*: Applied Learning Lab, Foundaations of Biomedical Informatics Methods I
- *Next Up*: Capstone I and II

## 🔬 What I'm Working On

📊 **Tea-rrific Analysis** — I cataloged and analyzed my 110+ tea collection because… why not?  
💔 **Heartbreak & Data** — Explored relationship status and heart health using NHANES in a project for Statistics I at ASU inspired by “Broken Heart Syndrome” ([yes, it’s real!](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354617)).  
🧬 **Capstone Planning** — Soon, I'll be starting my final capstone for my Master's Program, working with data and collaborating with a few classmates to flesh out a noteworthy project and earn my degree!

## 💬 Let’s Connect

I'm the **Online Cohort Ambassador** for ASU's BDS program, and I love talking with others about learning paths, career pivots, and weirdly specific datasets. We're also interested in hosting workshops and talks for the students in our program, and postentially beyond. If you know anyone (or you yourself) fit this bill and you're interested, let's chat!

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I’ve participated in two major archaeological digs:  
🏺 One at a Mayan site in Belize, and another at a 17th-century graveyard in Poland.  
🍁 I also worked in public sector archaeology in ON, Canada from mid 2020 to late 2021.  
Let’s just say… I *really* dig bones.

## 🤝 Inspired By
I love learning from folks like Jess Ramos, Daliana Liu, and Andrew Jones, who make data science feel exciting, accessible, and full of possibility. If you have other creators or newsletters you recommend, send them my way!
